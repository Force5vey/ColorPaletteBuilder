Major Issues:

​	List View "flashes" when being refreshed. Very annoying on the eyes.

XAML Errors

Custom Button: Border Brush

​	Theme Resource Line for Border Brush is commented out until further resolution.

TitleBar File Name Binding: Sets to the default value, does not update.

​	While sorting this out, I deleted the several areas the titlebar filename was updated on open and save etc.

so if I don't get binding sorted out then I need to read add the updated file name appropriately.

otherwise I left off after getting rid of loadlastsession and setting it up to use loadpalette directly with the local value for lastsession filename.



so either fix the binding or the next thing is to go through and continue organizing and streaminling the viewmodel methods to get rid of redundancy.

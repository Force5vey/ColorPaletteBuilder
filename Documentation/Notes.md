binding:



so, followed binding from the msdn file.

it works kind of but still having troubles. there was a change going to the full setup where load and save worked but not open. and then I removed the private field and just kept the public property of colorpalettedata in mainviewmodel and then it stoped showing on load.

continue to change around the properties etc to nail down the issue with the update to the property and it loading.

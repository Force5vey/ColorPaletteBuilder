# Design Document for Color Palette Builder

------

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of the Color Palette Builder application is to provide designers, artists, and developers with a versatile tool to select, store, log, and organize colors. Users can categorize colors by customizable names, states, and groups. This tool is intended to work independently of major photo editing software, offering a seamless way to manage and retrieve color palettes for various projects. It simplifies the process of transferring color codes to other applications via the clipboard.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this application includes:

- Application designers
- Game developers
- Website designers
- Artists
- Anyone who regularly uses color selections in their work

## 2. System Overview

- **WinUI 3**: Utilized for the user interface, providing modern and responsive design capabilities.
- **Main Window**: Central hub for user interaction, featuring a command bar and list view for color management.
- **JSON File Format**: Used for saving and loading color palettes, with a custom `.cpb` extension for easy organization and searching.

### Main Components

- **Main Window**: Hosts the primary interface, including the color picker, list view, and command bar.
- **Settings Window**: Allows users to configure application settings.
- **Models**: Represent data structures for colors and palettes.
- **Services**: Handle file operations and color conversions.

## 3. Features and Functional Requirements

### Core Features

- **Color Picker**: Select colors with precise control over alpha channels.
- **Color Logging**: Store and organize colors with customizable names, states, and groups.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy color codes in various formats (Hex, RGBA, C#) to the clipboard for easy transfer.
- **File Operations**: Save and load color palettes in JSON format with a `.cpb` extension.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter colors by state and group to focus on specific categories.

### Optional Features and Future Enhancements

  :

  - **Command Bar**: Provides quick access to common functions (New, Open, Save, etc.).
  - **Color Picker**: Interface for selecting colors.
  - **ListView**: Displays and allows editing of color entries.
  - **Filtering Options**: Dropdowns for selecting states and groups.

### Wireframes and User Flow

      public string ElementState { get; set; }
      public string ElementGroup { get; set; }
      public string HexCode { get; set; }
      public string DisplayColor { get; set; }
      public string ChangeColor { get; set; }
      public string SendColor { get; set; }
      public string Note { get; set; }
      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
      // Additional properties and methods...
  }
  ```

- **ColorPalette.cs**:

  ```
  csharpCopy codepublic class ColorPalette : INotifyPropertyChanged
  {
      public string ColorPaletteName { get; set; }
      public string ColorPaletteFile { get; set; }
      public ObservableCollection<string> ElementStates { get; set; }
      public ObservableCollection<string> ElementGroups { get; set; }
      public ObservableCollection<ColorEntry> ColorEntries { get; set; }
      public ObservableCollection<ColorEntry> FilteredColorEntries { get; set; }
      public string FileHeader { get; set; }
      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
      // Additional properties and methods...
  }
  ```

- **UserSettings.cs**: Placeholder for user-specific settings.
